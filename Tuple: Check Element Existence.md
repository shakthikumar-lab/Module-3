# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
tup = eval(input("Enter a tuple of elements with characters and numbers:")) if 'n' in tup and 8 in tup : print ("The character 'n' and the number (8) are exists in the given tuple") elif 'n' in tup and 8 not in tup : print ("The character 'n' exists in the given tuple but the number (8) doesn't exist") elif 'n' not in tup and 8 in tup : print ("The number (8) exists in the given tuple but the character 'n' doesn't exist") else: print("Both 'n' and 8 are not exist in the givn tuple")
